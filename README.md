I am a autistic teenager who has a passion in computer science, games, and mathematics. Most of my experience is self-taught, beginning from when my friends encouraged me to learn programming the COVID lockdown. They did not know much programming at that time, so I ended up progressing mostly on my own, at a faster rate than they did.
