I am a autistic teenager who has a passion in computer science, games, and mathematics. Most of my experience is self-taught, beginning from when my friends encouraged me to learn programming the COVID lockdown. They did not know much programming at that time, so I ended up progressing mostly on my own, at a faster rate than they did.

Yes, I was formerly a user of Scratch. I've done most of my programming work in other languages for quite a while, however.

## Why another new account?
This account is intended to showcase a higher standard of quality, effort, and practicality than my older accounts. Nothing will be perfect, but I commit to maintaining most if not all of the projects on this profile.
If you search well enough, you could eventually find older projects. These come with no guarantee of being decent or actively maintained.
