I am a autistic teenager who has a passion in computer science, games, and mathematics. Most of my experience is self-taught, beginning from when my friends encouraged me to learn programming the COVID lockdown. They did not know much programming at that time, so I ended up progressing mostly on my own, at a faster rate than they did.

## Core beliefs
- You should learn things yourself. Don't rely on the school system for all bits of your education.
- Don't use an engine for everything, especially Unity. This is just extra bloat and gives you less control over the game.
- Getting people to notice your projects is a huge nightmare.
- I am critical of the school to college to work pipeline, and attempt to find ways around it, to be more independent within life.
